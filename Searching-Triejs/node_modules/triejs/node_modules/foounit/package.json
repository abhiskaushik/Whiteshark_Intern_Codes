  "readme": "# foounit ![Project status](http://stillmaintained.com/foobarfighter/foounit.png)\n\nA functionally scoped BDD style test framework that runs everywhere.\n\n### Key features:\n\n* Asyncronous test running\n* Out of the box support for multiple javascript host environments: node.js, major browsers, Adobe AIR, The Ruby Racer\n* BDD style test running\n* A simple API\n\n### Contrived Example\n    var MyLib = foounit.require(':src/my_lib');\n\n    foounit.add(function (kw){ with(kw){\n      describe('when something happens', function (){\n        var myLib;\n        before(function (){\n          myLib = new MyLib();\n        });\n\n        it('does something awesome', function (){\n          expect(myLib.someFunc()).to(equal, 'foo');\n        });\n      });\n    }});\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\n### Quick Start for Browser Testing\n1. Create a directory to put your tests\n2. Drop in the example suite\n3. Start a web server\n4. Point your web browser at your server location\n\n### Quick Start for Node Testing\n1. TODO\n\n### Quick Start for Shared Environment Testing\n1. TODO\n\n## Do we run everywhere yet? - NO\n\n### Browser\n* Firefox\n  * Firefox 3.x - YES\n  * Firefox 4.x - YES\n* Chrome - YES\n* Safari - YES\n* Internet Explorer\n  * IE6 - YES\n  * IE7 - YES\n  * IE8 - YES\n  * IE9 - ?\n\n### Comand line\n* Node.js - YES\n* Rhino - NO\n* spidermonkey - ??\n\n### Other\n* Adobe AIR - NO\n* The Ruby Racer - NO\n* Webkit Mobile - NO\n\n## Known Issues\n* Stack trace reporting in the browser doesn't really help that much.\n* XhrLoadingStrategy is not good enough.  We lose stack trace info in the eval.\n* The UI for browser based running is not where I want it to be yet.\n\n## About\nTODO\n\n## Other Alternatives\n\n### foounit isn't for you?\nThere's a lot of great unit testing frameworks for javascript these days.  It's more important that people are testing their code than it is that people use foounit.\n\nSome notable alternatives are:\n\n* jasmine    (This is also a rewrite of Screw Unit)\n* shoulda.js (BDD with different syntax)\n* vows       (BDD with different syntax)\n* logan      (Cross environment unit testing)\n\n## Greetz\n* mde - for providing good ideas\n* peterbraden - for identifying problems with foounit's first iteration\n* nathansobo - for rewriting Screw Unit while I was at Grockit which got me this far\n* Alex Russell and James Burke - for being a sounding board for synchronous loader ideas\n* jasmine for beating me to the punch :) and also providing a better API than I originally had\n",
